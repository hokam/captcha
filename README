After installation process you need to add 'before_filter' callback in your controller to create captcha image before
the processing of specified actions.

Suppose you have a CommentsController in which you want to create capthca image for "new" action so just add the following
lines in your controller.

class CommentsController << ActionController::Base
  before_filter :create_captcha, :only => [:new]

	# ....
	# ....

end

And for validation of captcha text you need to call validate_captcha funtion in the required action.
Lets say in "create" action of CommentsController you want to apply captcha validation, so do the following addition
in your 'create' action.


class CommentsController << ActionController::Base
  before_filter :create_captcha, :only => [:new]

	def new
		# action related data
	end

	# other action methods

  def create

    if validate_captcha
      # ........
    else
      # ........
    end

  end
end

And add the following line in your html view to create captcha image.

<%= image_captcha_tag %>

captcha failure message will be available in flash[:notice] variable.
